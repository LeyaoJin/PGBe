# Tissue Specificity Analyzer

This tool allows users to analyze chromatin accessibility across tissues using ChIP-seq peak files and tissue-specific DNase-seq data. The analysis is performed using [ChIPseeker](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChIPseeker.html) and visualized with `ggplot2`.

## Features
- Upload `narrowPeak` and `BED` files to perform the analysis.
- Generate tissue-specific chromatin accessibility bar plots.
- User-friendly configuration of analysis parameters.

## Requirements
